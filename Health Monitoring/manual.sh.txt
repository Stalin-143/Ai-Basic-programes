echo "This script describes the functionality and usage of the Health Monitoring System implemented in Python."
echo ""
echo "--------------------------"
echo "System Overview:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "The Health Monitoring System is a Python-based application designed to simulate, analyze, and monitor health metrics."
echo "Key Features include:"
echo "  1. Synthetic Data Generation for heart rate, step count, and activity."
echo "  2. Anomaly Detection using DBSCAN clustering."
echo "  3. Activity Classification using a Random Forest model."
echo "  4. Real-Time Data Simulation."
echo "  5. Visualization of health trends and detected anomalies."
echo ""
echo "--------------------------"
echo "System Steps & Functionality:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "1. Generate Data:"
echo "   - Simulates health data for heart rate, step count, and activity over time."
echo "   - Adds timestamps to each data point."
echo ""
echo "2. Preprocess Data:"
echo "   - Normalizes the features (heart rate and step count) using StandardScaler for better model performance."
echo ""
echo "3. Train Activity Classification Model:"
echo "   - Splits the data into training and test sets."
echo "   - Uses Random Forest Classifier with cross-validation for training."
echo "   - Evaluates the model with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."
echo ""
echo "4. Detect Anomalies:"
echo "   - Applies DBSCAN clustering to detect outliers in the health data."
echo "   - Marks outliers as anomalies and visualizes them in a time-series plot."
echo ""
echo "5. Simulate Real-Time Data:"
echo "   - Samples random data points from the dataset to simulate real-time health monitoring."
echo "   - Displays heart rate, step count, activity type, and anomaly status in real-time."
echo ""
echo "6. Visualize Health Metrics:"
echo "   - Plots time-series data for heart rate and step count."
echo "   - Highlights anomalies for easy identification of irregularities."
echo ""
echo "--------------------------"
echo "Instructions to Run:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "1. Ensure Python 3.x and the required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn) are installed."
echo "   To install the libraries, run:"
echo "     pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn"
echo ""
echo "2. Copy the Python code into a file (e.g., health_monitor.py)."
echo ""
echo "3. Run the Python script:"
echo "     python health_monitor.py"
echo ""
echo "4. Follow the output to observe model training results, anomaly detection, and real-time data simulation."
echo ""
echo "--------------------------"
echo "Additional Notes:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "- Modify the 'data_size' parameter in the Python code to adjust the size of the simulated dataset."
echo "- Customize the thresholds in the DBSCAN algorithm for different sensitivity levels."
echo "- Extend the system to integrate real-world data sources or send alerts for anomalies."
