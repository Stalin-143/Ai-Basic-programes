# README for AI-Powered REST API Script
# ================================================================================
# This PowerShell script demonstrates how to interact with multiple AI-powered
# REST APIs (e.g., Sentiment Analysis, Language Translation, Image Recognition) 
# using Azure Cognitive Services and similar platforms. It integrates 5 different 
# AI capabilities into one script and provides examples of usage.
#
# The script includes the following features:
# 1. Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a text.
# 2. Text Translation: Translates a text input into English (or other languages).
# 3. Image Recognition: Analyzes an image file to generate descriptions of the content.
# 4. Text Key Phrase Extraction: Extracts key phrases from the input text.
# 5. Language Detection: Detects the language of the input text.
#
# Required Setup:
# 1. Replace <your-api-key> with your actual API key for each AI service.
# 2. Replace <your-endpoint> with the actual endpoint for each AI service.
# 3. Ensure that you have access to the APIs, such as Azure Cognitive Services, 
#    or other REST-based AI services that require authentication.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Save this script as ai-rest-apis.ps1.
# 2. Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where this script is saved.
# 3. Run the script:
#    ```powershell
#    ./ai-rest-apis.ps1
#    ```
# 4. Follow the prompts to input text or specify an image file for analysis.
# 5. The script will call the respective API functions and display the results.
#
# API Functions:
# 1. Get-SentimentAnalysis: Analyzes the sentiment of a text.
# 2. Get-TextTranslation: Translates text into the target language.
# 3. Get-ImageRecognition: Recognizes objects and describes the content of an image.
# 4. Get-TextKeyPhrases: Extracts key phrases from the input text.
# 5. Get-LanguageDetection: Detects the language of the provided text.
#
# Example of Usage:
# - Enter a piece of text for sentiment analysis.
# - Enter any text to be translated (e.g., "Hola, ¿cómo estás?").
# - Specify an image file to get its description (e.g., a photo of a cat).
#
# Notes:
# - Be sure to replace the placeholders in the script with your actual credentials.
# - The APIs used in this script are based on Azure Cognitive Services, but you can
#   modify it to use other similar AI platforms that offer REST APIs.
#
# DISCLAIMER:
# - This script is for educational purposes and may require a valid subscription 
#   to access the APIs.
