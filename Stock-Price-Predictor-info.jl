Stock Price Predictor
=====================

Description:
------------
This project is a Stock Price Predictor built using Julia. It leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze historical stock price data and predict future trends. By training on sequential data, the model identifies patterns to make predictions, making it useful for financial analysis and decision-making.

Features:
---------
1. **Data Normalization**: Prepares data for efficient training.
2. **LSTM Implementation**: Uses advanced deep learning techniques for time-series forecasting.
3. **Training and Testing**: Divides data into training and testing sets for model validation.
4. **Visualization**: Plots actual vs. predicted stock prices for easy interpretation.
5. **Model Saving**: Allows saving and reusing the trained model.

Advantages:
-----------
- **Accurate Predictions**: LSTM models handle time-series data effectively.
- **Customizable**: Sequence length, epochs, and learning rate can be adjusted.
- **Visualization**: Provides clear insights into the model's performance.
- **Reusable**: Saved model can be loaded and used for future predictions.
- **Efficient**: Leverages Julia's speed for faster computations.

Disadvantages:
--------------
- **Data Dependency**: Predictions depend heavily on the quality and quantity of historical data.
- **Computationally Intensive**: Training deep learning models can require significant computational resources.
- **Overfitting Risk**: Requires careful tuning of parameters to avoid overfitting.
- **Limited Explanability**: Neural networks often act as black boxes, making it hard to interpret their decisions.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Julia 1.8+.
2. Libraries:
   - Flux.jl (for neural networks)
   - CSV.jl and DataFrames.jl (for data handling)
   - Plots.jl (for visualization)
   - Statistics (for data normalization)

Usage:
------
1. **Prepare Dataset**:
   - Save historical stock price data as `stock_prices.csv`.
   - Ensure the file contains a column named "Close" for closing prices.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command in Julia REPL to install required libraries:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add(["Flux", "CSV", "DataFrames", "Plots", "Statistics"])
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Save the provided code as `stock_price_predictor.jl`.
   - Run the script using:
     ```bash
     julia stock_price_predictor.jl
     ```

4. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - Modify sequence length (`seq_len`) and epochs (`train!(epochs)`) as needed.

5. **View Results**:
   - The script plots actual vs. predicted stock prices.

6. **Save Model**:
   - Trained model is saved as `stock_price_predictor.bson` for reuse.

Future Enhancements:
--------------------
- Incorporating additional features such as volume and technical indicators.
- Implementing other models (GRU, Transformers) for comparison.
- Adding hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
